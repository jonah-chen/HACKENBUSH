# This is a sample world generation file.
# Use the pound symbol to write comments.

# Currently, only the basic world generator is supported

# For instance, here I am creating a green branch between the coordinates
# (1,1,0) and (0,0,0)
b g 1 1 0 -> 0 0 0

# Here I am creating a red branch from (1,2,0) to (1,1,0)
b r 1 2 0 -> 1 1 0

b g 1 3 0 -> 0 0 1
b g 1 3 0 -> 1 2 0

b b 1 4 0 -> 0 0 2

#b f 1 3 0 :: 0 11 0 g 1 0
